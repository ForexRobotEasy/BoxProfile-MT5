# BoxProfile MT5

This code is a custom indicator called BoxProfile for MetaTrader 5 (MT5). It is used to analyze volume profiles and clusters in the forex market. The indicator calculates the profile values based on the price range and volume data of the market.

## How it Works
The indicator works by dividing the price range of each candle into fixed clusters, determined by the input variable `ProfileStepPoint`. It then calculates the volume for each cluster and accumulates it in the `clusterBuffer`. The `profileBuffer` is then set to the same values as the `clusterBuffer`, representing the profile values.

The indicator keeps track of the profile length and doubles it every time the number of candles exceeds the current profile length. This allows for a more detailed analysis of volume profiles and clusters over time.
